# nanohr

A collection of syntax highlighters for the nano editor

## About the collection

This is my collection of **nanorc** files that have come together over the years.

I do not claim any ownership of the nanorc files. In fact most of them are from [serialhex]
[serialhex]: https://github.com/serialhex/nano-highlight "serialhex/nano-highlight"

The reasons why I am starting yet-another-nano repo are:
+ Some of the highlighting colors just don't work for me
+ I have come accross some languages that are just not featured

# Usage

I have designed the collection so that it can be used as is without any additional compilation steps.

The only thing thatyou have to do is to close the repository locally and make some sym links.
